1) Create a union of two queries that shows the names, cities, and ratings of all customers. Those with a rating of 200 or greater will also have the words “High Rating”, while the others will have the words “Low Rating”.
SELECT Name, City, 
       CASE WHEN Rating >= 200 THEN 'High Rating' ELSE 'Low Rating' END AS Rating_Status
FROM Customers
UNION
SELECT Name, City, 
       CASE WHEN Rating >= 200 THEN 'High Rating' ELSE 'Low Rating' END AS Rating_Status
FROM Customers;

2) Write a command that produces the name and number of each salesperson and each customer with more than one current order. Put the results in alphabetical order.
SELECT Name, COUNT(*) AS Order_Count
FROM (SELECT Name FROM Salespeople
      UNION ALL
      SELECT Name FROM Customers) AS PeopleOrders
JOIN Orders ON PeopleOrders.Name = Orders.Name
GROUP BY Name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY Name;
