Insert all salespeople with more than one customer into the Multicust table:
INSERT INTO Multicust (City, Name, Comm, Cnum)
SELECT s.City, s.Name, s.Comm, s.Cnum
FROM Salespeople s
JOIN (
    SELECT SalespersonID, COUNT(*) AS CustomerCount
    FROM Customers
    GROUP BY SalespersonID
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
) c ON s.Cnum = c.SalespersonID;

Delete all customers with no current orders:
DELETE FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID NOT IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM Orders);

 Increase by twenty percent the commissions of all salespeople with total orders above Rs. 3,000:
UPDATE Salespeople
SET Comm = Comm * 1.20
WHERE Cnum IN (
    SELECT o.SalespersonID
    FROM Orders o
    JOIN Salespeople s ON o.SalespersonID = s.Cnum
    GROUP BY o.SalespersonID
    HAVING SUM(o.Amount) > 3000
);
